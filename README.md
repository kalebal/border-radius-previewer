# border-radius-previewer

This is a just-fiddlin-around-repo to fiddle around with Ember.js and border radii.
It's a WIP, and probably always will be ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

That said, assuming I haven't used up my free tier allowance, you can find it deployed to Netlify [here.](https://634f4eb98c12e6220d3e1f87--spiffy-dieffenbachia-0939b9.netlify.app/)

A sneak peek:
